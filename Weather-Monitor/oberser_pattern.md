The Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many
dependency between objects so that when one
object changes state, all of its dependents are
notified and updated automatically.

### loose couple
- When two objects are loosely coupled, they can interact, but they typically have very little knowledge
of each other
- minimize the interdependency between objects
- observer pattern follows the principle of loose couple
